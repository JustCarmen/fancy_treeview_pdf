Fancy Treeview PDF
==================

PDF extension for the [Fancy Treeview module](https://github.com/JustCarmen/fancy_treeview)

This module requires [webtrees 1.7.3](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees) or later AND [Fancy Treeview 1.7.3](https://github.com/JustCarmen/fancy_treeview) or later. Download the latest stable release of this module [here](https://github.com/JustCarmen/fancy_treeview/releases).

Description
-----------
This module is an extension for the [Fancy Treeview module](https://github.com/JustCarmen/fancy_treeview). If you install this module it offers your users the possibility to download a Fancy Treeview page as PDF. Like the Fancy Treeview webpage, the PDF contains an overview of all descendants of a selected root person in a tree. It contains the same information as the Fancy Treeview page (images are included). Besides the PDF comes with an index with the names of all individuals in alphabetical order. It is designed to use with all kind of languages, including rtl-languages.

Required disk space
-------------------
The PDF-library and especially the font-library inside this library is huge. Since webtrees offers a lot of languages we need the extended font-library to serve your visitors from all parts of the world.
If you don’t need the PDF-option or you don’t have enough disk space on your server (minimum of 100MB free space is required) don’t install this extra module.

Translations
------------
This module doesn't contain any translation files. The few texts inside this module are added to the translation files inside the main module [Fancy Treeview](https://github.com/JustCarmen/fancy_treeview).

Stylesheets
------------
This module doesn't contain any stylesheets. The few styles used inside this module are added to the themefiles inside the main module [Fancy Treeview](https://github.com/JustCarmen/fancy_treeview).

Installation and updating
-------------------------
After you have installed this module goto the webtrees control panel to activate this module. If you don't see the Fancy Treeview PDF module in the list of installed modules, you probably haven't installed the Fancy Treeview module yet.
